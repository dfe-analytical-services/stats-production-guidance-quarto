Guidance for how to make sure content is accessible in the Explore Education Statistics platform

</p>

---

Explore Education Statistics (EES) is the Department's official statistics dissemination platform, designed to make DfE's published statistics and data easier to find, access, use and understand. We continually work to ensure that the service is as accessible as possible, however some elements of accessibility are directly related to the content produced in the platform, and this is where [better sentence here].

Definition

---

### Places it is used in EES

---

Good alt text:
* tells people what information the image provides
* describes the content and function of the image
* is specific, meaningful and concise
* uses normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand
* is not longer than 2 sentences in most situations

Do not write alt text that:
* includes the name of the photographer or person who created the image
* starts with ‘Image of’, ‘Graphic of’ or common information that would repeat across every image
* repeats information from the page
* includes extra information not in the image

# Written content

---

How we write is often as important for accessibility as the publishing platform we use. Research shows that [higher literacy people prefer plain English](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/17/guest-post-clarity-is-king-the-evidence-that-reveals-the-desperate-need-to-re-think-the-way-we-write/) because it allows them to understand the information as quickly as possible.


We recommend you regularly review the written content you produce, if you'd like help with this, have a look at the publication scrums that we offer. These are a great opportunity

To avoid confusion, technical terms are fine to use, and often are unavoidable, you just need to explain what they mean in plain English when you use them. Treat it as an opportunity to teach your users the terminology.

## Using headings

---

How to use them in EES

---

### Structuring headings

---

Cover the ordering and logic

---

### Common pitfalls

---

Don't use bold

Don't have them overly long

Make sure they're understandable out of context

---

## Whitespace

---

Don't have blank headers for this

Don't have excessive lines

Headers already give you enough space

---

## Footnotes

---

Just don't do them.

---

# Hyperlinks

---

## Common pitfalls
